questions we are looking to answer:
- how has music changed over time? 
- what words are more prevalent in certain types of songs?
- what are the popularity trends across different genres?
- what makes up a "good artist"?
- are certain types of songs more popular in different countries? 
- what kind of changes can we observe that coincide with the pandemic?

implementation:
- using this link https://spotifycharts.com/regional/global/daily/2021-02-03, look at the global charts and charts by country for each month
  - start with looking into past 5 - 10 years of data to get an idea of what the "norm" is
