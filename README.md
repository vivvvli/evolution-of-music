project idea - spotify

how has music changed over time? 
what words are more prevalent in certain types of songs?
what are the popularity trends across different genres?
what makes up a "good artist"?
are certain types of songs more popular in different countries? 
what kind of changes can we observe that coincide with the pandemic?


approach:
- look at the global charts and charts by country for each month; should start with looking into past 5 - 10 years of data to get an idea of what the "norm" is
